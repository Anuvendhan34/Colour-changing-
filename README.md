# Colour-changing-
Interactive Canvas Animation with Ripple Effect

This project creates an interactive, animated canvas using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a color-changing background triggered by mouse or touch events, generating ripple effects, particle animations, and dynamic circle shapes. The canvas supports multiple color themes and handles resizing to fit any screen size. It includes additional features like inactive user handling and faux-clicking animations for continuous interaction. The project is built with the Anime.js library to handle smooth animations and transitions.
